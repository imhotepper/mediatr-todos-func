This repo details a simple TodosApi built with Azure Functions, just post and get all, that delegates the logic using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library. For validation [FluentValidaton](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) is used.

The features used from MediatR are: 
- **Request/response**: for post and get all
- **Behaviors**: for user identification, logging and model validation


Please check the branches for the details.
